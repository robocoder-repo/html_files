        <h2>Common Digital Threats and Vulnerabilities</h2>
        <p>Understanding the various threats to your digital security is the first step in protecting yourself online. Here are some of the most common digital threats you should be aware of:</p>

        <details>
            <summary>Phishing Attacks</summary>
            <p>Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message.</p>
            <h4>Types of Phishing:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Phishing:</strong> The most common type, where attackers send fraudulent emails impersonating legitimate organizations.</li>
                <li><strong>Spear Phishing:</strong> Targeted attacks against specific individuals or companies.</li>
                <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> Phishing attacks targeting senior executives and other high-profile individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> Phishing conducted via SMS text messages.</li>
                <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> Voice phishing, where attackers use phone calls to deceive victims.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Always verify the sender's identity and be cautious about clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</p>
        </details>

        <details>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Malicious programs that can replicate themselves and spread to other computers.</li>
                <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Similar to viruses, but can spread without human action.</li>
                <li><strong>Trojan Horses:</strong> Malware disguised as legitimate software.</li>
                <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Malware that encrypts your files and demands payment for decryption.</li>
                <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Software that secretly monitors and collects information about you.</li>
                <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Software that automatically displays or downloads advertising material.</li>
            </ul>

        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Data Breaches</summary>
            <p>A data breach is a security incident in which information is accessed without authorization. Data breaches can hurt businesses and consumers in a variety of ways, from revealing personal information to providing access to bank accounts.</p>
            <h4>Common causes of data breaches:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Weak and stolen credentials</li>
                <li>Application vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Malware</li>
                <li>Social engineering</li>
                <li>Too many permissions</li>
                <li>Insider threats</li>
                <li>Physical attacks</li>
                <li>Improper configuration and user error</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To protect yourself, use strong, unique passwords for each account, enable two-factor authentication when possible, and be cautious about sharing sensitive information online.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</summary>
            <p>In a MitM attack, an attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.</p>
            <h4>Common types of MitM attacks:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Hijacking:</strong> Attackers gain access to email accounts to monitor communications.</li>
                <li><strong>Wi-Fi Eavesdropping:</strong> Attackers intercept data on unsecured Wi-Fi networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> Attackers steal session cookies to gain unauthorized access to information or services.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Spoofing:</strong> Attackers disguise their identity by falsifying data and impersonating another computing system.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Protect yourself by using encrypted connections (HTTPS), avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, and using a VPN when necessary.</p>
